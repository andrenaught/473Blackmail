Adding in the database

1. create your own dpd
```
dpd create backend
```

2. Pull from this repo to get the resources folder (this containts the collections data) so we're all on the same database schema ( i think this will work )
```
git pull
```

Potential extra Features/Ideas (feel free to add stuff or start working on these, let us know if you are)
1. Countdown Timer, do something when it ends (maybe make it public to everyone in the site)
2. Stats page, showing top blackmailers, most often target, etc.
