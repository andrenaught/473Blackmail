# 473Blackmail


Adding in the database ( can't find a cleaner way of doing this sorry D: )

1. move the 'backend' folder out

2. create your own dpd
```
dpd create backend
```

3. drag in the files from the 'backend' folder you moved out to your newly created 'backend' folder with dpd (including the .gitignore file). Overwrite/replace when asked.

Potential extra Features/Ideas (feel free to add stuff or start working on these, let us know if you are)
1. Countdown Timer, do something when it ends (maybe make it public to everyone in the site)
2. Stats page, showing top blackmailers, most often target, etc.
